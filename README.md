Shadow Screen

An application for buying and selling components that are currently working in the computer. They are automatically detected and added to the database. The information on components is minimal (1-3 fields), so the user will need to manually enter data about them (automatic parameters cannot be changed). Editable parameters include the image and condition. Another type of editable parameter is those that require technical support confirmation and the most complete information about the part. Not all components can be sold; this is chosen by the user. A separate tab is provided for the user's build (there are three tabs in total). Any other user can click a button that will redirect them to a browser where the unchangeable parameters are already entered. This is the main feature: the user can compare and check how correctly the part data is filled out. As a result, the application is roughly the size of a mobile app (~1/4 of the screen). At the bottom is a quick menu between the three tabs: Search, My Build, and My Build. The selected tab is highlighted in the color chosen by the user in their profile.

Search Tab:
At the top, there is a text input field. Immediately below it is a dropdown list with criteria (~stars, views, author rating, etc.), and at the same height, the number of results.
Below, ads will be displayed in the necessary sorting.

My Build Tab:
At the top, the avatar and name of the user are displayed (other users will have the same profile view, but clicking on the part will redirect them to the partâ€™s link, not to settings or statistics).
They are displayed in the same style as the ads in the first tab. Clicking will allow the user to change the information about the part.

My Profile Tab:
At the top, there is a photo and name of the user. There are also separate tabs such as chats, delivery methods, my cards, about me, statistics of purchased and sold parts, and a universal code.

Additionally, any user can receive a code to authenticate in Telegram for automated responses to users.
